## Known Issues

### Failed Tests
1. **Test #28**: "Should load saved search criteria"
   - **File**: test/unit/space-manager.test.js
   - **Issue**: localStorage mock scope in Node.js environment
   - **Impact**: Low - Works correctly in browser
   - **Priority**: Low

### Not Executed Tests
1. **PowerShell Tests (35 tests)**
   - **Reason**: Require Pester framework installation
   - **Action**: Run with `Invoke-Pester`

2. **E2E Tests (105 tests)**
   - **Reason**: HTML structure alignment needed
   - **Action**: Update selectors or HTML elements

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit          # Run unit tests only
npm run test:integration   # Run integration tests only
npm run test:coverage      # Run with coverage report
npx playwright test        # Run E2E tests
Invoke-Pester ./test/powershell  # Run PowerShell tests

# Run all tests
npm run test:all
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fix localStorage test** (#28) - Implement proper mock for Node.js
2. **Execute PowerShell tests** - Install Pester and run test suite
3. **Align E2E tests** - Update HTML structure or test selectors
4. **Increase branch coverage** - Add tests for uncovered conditional paths
5. **Set up CI/CD** - Automate test execution in pipeline
